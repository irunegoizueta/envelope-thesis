Robotic manipulation of deformable objects is a challenging subject and can often be bothersome. The behavior of this kind of objects is difficult to predict because they are constantly changing their shape when they are exposed to external forces. However, deformable objects such as ropes, wires, strings, cloths, are present in industry and in our daily lifes. For that reason, we decided to focus our research on robotic manipulation of deformable objects. This project has been developed at the Robotics Institute of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology during a period of six months. The goal of this project is to open an arbitrarily tied string-envelope with a UR10 robot, using a Robotiq FT300 wrist force/torque sensor.
